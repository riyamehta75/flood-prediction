# Flood Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the occurrence of flooding based on historical rainfall patterns. We will work with a dataset containing information on annual and monthly rainfall along with historical flood occurrences.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

1. 'year': The year of the recorded data.
2. 'month': The month of the recorded data.
3. 'annual_rainfall': The total annual rainfall for the given year.
4. 'monthly_rainfall': The amount of rainfall for the specific month.
5. 'flood_occurrence': Binary variable indicating the occurrence of a flood (target variable).

## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood of flooding based on historical rainfall data. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we will create a model to forecast flood occurrences and evaluate its effectiveness.

## How to Use the Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the required libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
3. Save your dataset as 'flood_prediction_dataset.csv' in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to access the code.
5. Follow the step-by-step instructions outlined in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for tasks such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
